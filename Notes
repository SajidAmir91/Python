Introduction to Python for Data Science

Date Started: 8/29/2016
Website: 

Syllabus will cover:
  Basic Arithmetic and variables, and eventually how to handle data structures such as lists, arrays, and DataFrames. 
  Will be introduced to Python functions and control flow
  Data visualization with Python
  
Upon course completion I am supposed to have learned: 
  Python language fundamentals: basic syntax, variables, and types
  Create and manipulate regular Python lists
  Use functions and import packages
  Build Numpy arrays and perform interesting calculations
  Create and customize plots on real data
  Use Control flow and get to know the Pandas data frame
  
Python background:
  Guido Van Rossum created it
  General Purpose: build anything
  Open Source
  Lots of packages, also for data science:
    Many applications and fiends
  Will learn Python 3.0
  
Variables and Types:

  Variable:
    Specific, case-sensitive name for variables
    to find out what type of variable a certain variable is, following is the command:
    New commands learned:
      type(VariableName)
    
  Types:
    Strings
      Can be declared using "texthere" or 'texthere'
    Boolean
    
    In Python, different types behave differently during manipulation/computation. For example, 
    
    2+3 will yield a result of 5 while adding two strings, 'ab' + 'cd' will give 'abcd'
    
    However, interestingly if I want to say something like print ("I started with " + savings + " and awesome " + interestes) it will not work
    
  Type Conversion:
    In the aforementioned case, we need to use a type conversion. That is as we have string and floats/integers in the same command, it will not work. We have to use str() to convert the float or integer variables here
    New commands learned:
      str(), int(), float(), bool()
